Learning about rust by following a cookie cutter tutorial 

This is a basic project copied from the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ9YTY7ZgsI 

this is cookie cutter but i learned alot about how rust functions, and its syntax from it. I have an idea for another very simple game, one where a paddle rotates around a point to play pong, but we will have to wait and see if that ever happens. I enjoy working with R, and I think Ill be using it for passionprojects from here on out. I like C++, but this is so much easier to use and set up.
I additionally leatned about visual studio code, and I am taking the opportunity to start documenting my learning and passion projects though github. very cool.
